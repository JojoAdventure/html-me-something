            <p>The Legend of Zelda is the first game of the series. In this game, Ganon is in his pig-like beast form. According to the instruction manual and the official website, shortly before the beginning of the game, Ganon broke free from the Dark World, and his army attacked Hyrule, stole the Triforce of Power, and captured the ruling Princess Zelda, but not before she had time to break up and hide the Triforce of Wisdom.</p>

            <h2>Zelda II: The Adventures of Link</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>The Adventure of Link takes place "several seasons" after the first game, and features the same Link, but a different Zelda. Moreover, the story references Ganon's destruction by Link in the first game. The game's back-story also references an old legend of Hyrule. According to it, long ago, a prince of Hyrule should have inherited the Triforce after the king's death, but he only obtained part of it. Indeed, his sister, Princess Zelda, let him keep the Triforce of Power and the Triforce of Wisdom, but the late king hid the Triforce of Courage. The prince and a magician questioned Zelda, but she refused to reveal the location of the last piece of the Triforce. In anger, the magician cast an eternal sleeping spell on Zelda, before dying himself. In grief, the prince ordered that all future girls of the royal family be named Zelda. The previous historical Zelda who hid the Triforce of Courage is still asleep at the beginning of the game, and is awakened by Link after he retrieves the Triforce of Courage at the end of the story. This Princess Zelda is not the same one rescued by Link in the first The Legend of Zelda game. The events of this legend were never mentioned in any other games of the series.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>A Link to the Past is the first of many Zelda games to have Hyrule's history told within the game, and the first in which Ganon's real name, Ganondorf, is revealed. During this game, Ganon is in his demonic form, and sealed in the "Golden Land", more commonly known as the Sacred Realm, with the Triforce. The game's instruction manual tells how all three pieces of the Triforce were originally hidden in the Golden Land. One day long ago, it was found by Ganondorf the Thief, and it granted his evil wish for a monstrous army to attack Hyrule. While the Knights of Hyrule defended the land, the Seven Sages created a magic seal to close off the Golden Realm. The game itself revolves around Ganon's ultimately-successful attempt to break the Sages' seal. Princess Zelda alerts Link to this, and Link goes on a quest to find the Master Sword, its first named appearance in the series, then defeats Ganon to reclaim the Triforce, using various means to travel between Hyrule and the Golden Land, now called the Dark World, during his efforts.</p>

            <h2>Ocarina of Time</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>Ocarina of Time was confirmed by Shigeru Miyamoto as the first in the series' continuity at the time of its release. At the beginning of the game, Ganondorf, the king of the Gerudo tribe, has not yet gained the Triforce, though he does possess magical powers. As the game progresses, Ganondorf follows Link into the Sacred Realm and, as Link pulls the Master Sword from its pedestal, he appears, telling Link he will rule Hyrule as a result of Link giving him access to the Sacred Realm. Link is then promptly put into suspended animation for seven years, until he is "of age" to wield the Master Sword. In the meantime, Ganondorf finds the Triforce, but because his heart is not balanced, it divides into its three pieces: Power, Wisdom, and Courage. Ganondorf retains the Triforce of Power, and uses it to take over and rule Hyrule for seven years. When Link wakes seven years later, he eventually awakens the Seven Sages and defeats Ganondorf, the Sages then sealing him in the Sacred Realm.</p>

              <figcaption>Majora's Mask Box Art</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Majora's Mask takes place after the events of Ocarina of Time, and stars the same Link, after returning to his youth. While traveling, he is attacked by a Skull Kid and accidentally enters a parallel world called Termina, which is going to be destroyed by a falling moon in three days. Link must relive the same three days repeatedly while trying to undo the events created by the Skull Kid through the power of Majora's Mask, and find a way to stop the impending apocalypse.</p>
            <p>Majora's Mask is a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, and thus far the only console release to serve as such. It is the only major Zelda title to not involve Zelda or Ganondorf, and one of the few Zelda titles to not take place in Hyrule, though it is mentioned.</p>

            <p>The Wind Waker takes place hundreds of years after Ocarina of Time. Hyrule has been lost for centuries, and now all that remains of its civilization are a few scattered islands on the Great Sea. Halfway through The Wind Waker, the Link and Zelda from this game discover they are the successors to their counterparts in the old kingdom of Hyrule, now drowned beneath the Great Sea. It is revealed in dialogue between survivors of Hyrule that the Link of The Wind Waker is not related to the Hero of Time, the Link of Ocarina of Time; later on in the game, he is referred to as the "Hero of Winds".</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Twilight Princess takes place at least a hundred years after Ocarina of Time. In an interview with Japan's Nintendo Dream Magazine, series director Eiji Aonuma stated that Twilight Princess occurs in a "parallel" world to The Wind Waker, following an alternate timeline in which Ganondorf does not take over Hyrule, and is instead sentenced to execution following the conclusion of Ocarina of Time.</p>

              <figcaption>Skyward Sword Box Art</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Skyward Sword takes place at the beginning of the Zelda continuity, detailing the origins of the Master Sword, a recurring weapon and major plot point within many games of the series. The current incarnation of Link, resident of a floating town called Skyloft, heads on a quest to rescue his childhood friend Zelda after she is kidnapped and spirited to the Surface, an abandoned land below the clouds. Armed with the Goddess Sword and aided by a spirit named Fi, Link must ensure Zelda's safety and stop Ghirahim as he attempts to resurrect his master. Skyward Sword was released to celebrate the Legend of Zelda franchise's 25th anniversary.</p>
            <p>Ganondorf is not explicitly mentioned in this game, though his spiritual predecessor, Demise, serves as an explanation for the centuries-long battle between him and the Royal Family. Upon his defeat at the hands of Link, he curses Link and Zelda's lineage to forever battle evil, thus creating Ganon. It has also been confirmed as of Skyward Sword that, while Link and Zelda are of a lineage, Ganondorf is the same eternal entity appearing in each title. He then canonically appears in Ocarina of Time, not yet having realized his title as the King of Evil.</p>

            <h2>Breath of the Wild</h2>

              <figcaption>Breath of the Wild Box Art</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Breath of the Wild takes place 100 years following the destruction of much of the land of Hyrule by Calamity Ganon, a formless manifestation of evil. Following these events, Calamity Ganon was sealed within Hyrule Castle by Princess Zelda where he lay dormant, but not defeated. Accompanying Zelda were five "champions" of Hyrule, four of which lost their lives, and one - Link, the main character - also sealed away in order to both preserve his life and hopefully defeat Calamity Ganon when he eventually awakens. Upon awakening, Link must regain his memories and re-learn his mission.</p>
            <p>Breath of the Wild is considered a milestone for the franchise, eschewing many traditions in gameplay and storytelling that the Zelda franchise has been known for for decades, as well as being the first open-world free-roaming Zelda title. The game suffered from a very long development cycle, originally intended for the Wii U in 2014 and finally releasing as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch in 2017, but was greatly received upon launch, going on to win Game of the Year at the 2017 Game Awards. The timeline placement of Breath of the Wild is uncertain, as no official statement from Nintendo has been made. </p>
